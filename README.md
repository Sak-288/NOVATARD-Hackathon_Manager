# NOVATARD-Hackathon_Manager
A simple solution for our organizers and volunteers to check : whether particpants have signed the release of liabality (we don't want to go to jail), check the number &amp; identity of participants in each workshop and get data on the overall participant tool. It mainly uses the airtable API.

UPDATE : 

SO yeah... Hackclub did the exact same thing (but obviously better) for Daydream 2025, so... yeah this is defunct. But it was fun.
